# Computer-Virus-Infection-Tracing
In this simple project work, the spread of computer virus is modelled with a SIRS model and studied in the context of a computer network generated with the Preferential Attachment method. An Infection Tracing Tool is proposed to limit the virus diffusion in critical conditions and evaluated exploiting network analisys measures.
